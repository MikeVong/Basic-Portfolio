        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My name is Quay Vong, my nickname is Mike.
        I have been with my wife for 12 years and have a beautiful 2 year old daughter and soon 
        I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with bachelor of arts degree at 2005. 
        I quickly got a job working for the Geek Squad at Best Buy the same year. 
        I worked as an onsite IT technician called Double Agent for 11 years. 
        Afterword, I want to get out of retail. 
        I worked for a charter school for 3 years as an IT technician again, and after that. 
        I want to dive deeper into web developer , I want to have a change of career. 
        And here I am.
