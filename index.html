            My name is Quay Vong, my nickname is Mike. 
            I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with bachelor of arts degree at 2005. 
            I quickly got a job working for the Geek Squad at Best Buy the same year. 
            I worked as an onsite IT technician called Double Agent for 11 years. 
            After I want to get out of retail. 
            I worked for a charter school for 3 years as an IT technician again.
            after that. 
            I want to dive deeper into web developer , I want to have a change of career. 
            And here I am.
